# fsm-minimize
A minimizer for a finite state machine. This project was done for an
assigment at university. It servers for educational purposes, to see how
the steps should be implemented and to visualize the graphs. 

Although, I would recommand to use a lower level language, as it may have some
troubles if a finite state machine gets big enough.

Note: you need to have pygraphviz in order to make graphical
representations. Before you install the requirement, you should
install its dependecies.
If you're on ubuntu, see this steps :
